Self-Taught Data Scientist: Showcase Yourself with a PersonalÂ Website

Not having a college degree in data science makes it difficult to convince others of your skills. Not having any job experience makes it even more difficult.
I know, this may not seem fair!
As you worked hard to develop all those skills by spending countless hours on your computer and figuring out how those mind-wracking algorithms work, you think employers have to recognise you as a decent data scientist and give you the job opportunity you are striving for.
This will happen unless you show them all your skills with the solid pieces of evidence by differentiating yourself from the others.
Having a personal website provides a platform for you to showcase your skills.
In this post, I will explain how you can create your website easily and almost free. All source code is provided in my GitHub repository and you can visit the personal website to see it in the action.
In the first part of the post, I will cover what specifically you should present in your website. Then in the later section, I will show you how you can handle website development tasks from start to end, including setting up the hosting/domain services and handling the HTML/CSS development.
